Hey there! Iâ€™m Thanos Maris, a Data Analyst at Vodafone Greece with a love for learning, exploring new ideas, and diving into data. 
With over 18 years of experience spanning retail sales, customer management, and data analysis, Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with amazing teams and tackle all kinds of challenges.
Iâ€™m all about teamwork and finding creative, practical solutions that deliver real results. I get excited about new technologies and love figuring out how to put them to good use.
